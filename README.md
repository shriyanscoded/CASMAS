# 🎓 CasMas: Master Your Scientific Calculator

**CasMas** is a high-fidelity, educational simulator built to help students master the physical tools they use in exams. By replicating the exact layout and logic of the **Casio fx-991ES PLUS**, it provides a risk-free environment to practice complex syntax and function mapping.

## 🚀 Why CasMas?
Standard calculator apps prioritize efficiency, but students often struggle in exams because they aren't familiar with their **physical hardware**. CasMas focuses on:
* **Tactile Familiarity:** Matches button locations and secondary functions (`Shift`/`Alpha`) of the real-world device.
* **Educational Guidance:** Includes a specialized **Guide Mode** to teach students the "Why" and "How" behind complex functions.
* **Natural Display (V.P.A.M.):** Mimics the system for writing fractions and square roots exactly as they appear in textbooks.

## ✨ Features
* **Core Math Engine:** Full support for basic arithmetic and order of operations.
* **Mode Selection:** Integrated system to toggle between different calculation modes (COMP, etc.).
* **Guide Mode:** A toggleable educational layer that provides instant tooltips for every key.
* **Responsive Design:** Built with **Tailwind CSS** for a pixel-perfect look on desktop and mobile.

## 🛠️ Built With
* **Framework:** Next.js (App Router)
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
* **Logic:** Custom JavaScript Math Engine

## 🚧 Project Roadmap
* [x] **Initial UI Design:** High-fidelity skeuomorphic Casio layout.
* [x] **Core Math Engine:** Handling of basic operators and BODMAS logic.
* [x] **Mode Logic:** Initial implementation of the "Mode" selection system.
* [ ] **Modifier Layers:** Activate `SHIFT` and `ALPHA` keys for secondary functions.
* [ ] **Natural Display:** Render fractions and radicals using LaTeX/KaTeX.
